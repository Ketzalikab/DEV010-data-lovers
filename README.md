## 1. Preamble

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read),
90% of the data that exists today has been created in the last two years. Every day, we generate 2.5 million terabytes of data, an unprecedented figure.

However, data by itself is of little use. In order for these massive amounts of data to become easily readable **information** for users, we need to understand and process this data. One simple way to do this is by creating interfaces and visualizations.

In the following image, you can see how an user-friendly and understandable interface can be built on the right side using the data shown on the left:

## 2. Project Summary

In this project, a web page is built to visualize a set of data that is tailored to what you discover our user needs.

The final deliverable is a web page that allows for data visualization, filtering, sorting, and performing some aggregated calculations. Aggregated calculations refer to various computations that can be applied to the data to display even more relevant information for users (average, maximum or minimum value, etc).

This time, a series of data from different themes is proposed, and in our case, we specifically chose the Pokemon datasets.

Once the area of interest is defined, the goal is to understand who our user is and what they specifically need to know or see. This understanding aids in constructing an interface that helps the user interact with and better comprehend the data. This project was a team effort, completed in approximately 3 weeks with 3 sprints.

The main objective of this project is to learn how to design and build a web interface where data can be visualized and manipulated, all while understanding the needs of the user.

## 3. Research

We asked some loyal Pokemon followers what the key features for an application of this kind would be, and they shared the following with us: "As a user/enthusiast/collector of POKEMON, I want an intuitive and straightforward interface to find the data I need, such as:

* Knowing the abilities/strengths/weaknesses to win battles.
* Visualizing the Pokémon by types.
* Finding Pokémon by name, Pokedex number."

On the other hand, we found the following information on the web: "A study presented by Survey Monkey Intelligence revealed some details about the usage of the augmented reality video game Pokémon Go. Regarding gender, the study indicates that 63% of Pokémon Go players are women, while 37% are men.

Furthermore, young adults between 18 and 29 years old are the ones who dedicate the most time to playing Pokémon Go, making up 46% of the player base. Meanwhile, users between 30 and 50 years old constitute 25% of the total players."

For this reason, we have defined our user within the age range of 18 to 29 years old, with a profile that leans more towards the female gender. This decision is based on the study's indication that this gender represents a higher percentage of players.

The most relevant data presented in the interface includes: sorting by numerical order in both ascending and descending order, sorting by type, rarity, and generation. On the homepage, we offer the option to explore different regions. One side features the Kanto region, while the other side features the Johto region. On the back of each created card, we've decided to display the special attack of each Pokémon. We have chosen to present these data points because they are the most significant in helping the user understand the value of their Pokémon. Based on this information, users can make decisions about collecting Pokémon and determine which opponents or types of Pokémon they might face in battles.

The product can be used both before and during the Pokémon collection process, during battles against other teams, or simply as an application that allows users to learn about the Pokémon within the Kanto and Johto regions.

## 6. Usability Testing

During the challenge, we conducted usability tests with different users to gather valuable feedback. Based on the insights obtained from these tests, we iterated on our designs to enhance the user experience. Below, we outline the usability issues we identified through the tests and the improvements we made in our final proposal.

**Identified Usability Issues**
Issue 1: Cards are displayed closely together without spacing, making them appear as solid blocks rather than distinct cards.
Issue 2: Filters perform filtering correctly but do not return values unless they are combined.
Issue 3: Users need to see a zero value within the filters.
Issue 4: A reset button is required to clear the selected filter values.
Issue 5: The user requests that we should be able to change the region when any filter is activated.

**Design Improvements**
Improvement 1: We had card information within a grid and added spacing with a gap to create separation between each card.
Improvement 2: We implemented a function to filter multiple filters together for more specific user searches.
Improvement 3: To make zero values noticeable, we included this value within the filters, allowing filtering according to user preferences.
Improvement 4: We added an extra button in the filter bar with the function to clear selected values from each filter.
Improvement 5:We made the region-changing function capable of identifying when a filter is activated, thus allowing the region to be changed when the button is pressed.

By conducting usability tests and iteratively refining our designs, we aimed to create a more user-friendly and effective solution.

## 7. Results
The following project was created to facilitate the search of Pokémon for enthusiasts. One of its functions is to organize the data regarding Pokémon from each region, both Johto and Kanto, and to filter the information by rarity, generation, and type. For this purpose, we have placed three search filters on a top bar, and at the same time, we have added a search by name or by number. At the end of the search filters, we have included a button that allows the user to reset the selected information and return the markers to their initial state.

The information is displayed in the form of cards. On the front side of each card, there is the image of each Pokémon, its name, and its assigned number. On the back side, its attack type is shown. The cards have a feature that allows them to flip when the cursor hovers over them.

The information can also be sorted in ascending and descending order. There are two buttons on the filter bar that enable this action.

At the bottom of the application, there is a region switch button. This button takes you to the data of the other region without needing to return to the home page.

To keep track of the region or type of filter applied, there is a marquee that displays the user's actions.

As a final addition to the application, we have implemented the functionality to determine the attack based on the Pokémon's type and its opponent's weakness.

The application is responsive for various devices.
